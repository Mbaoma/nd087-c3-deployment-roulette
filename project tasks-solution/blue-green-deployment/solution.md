I created a file called ```green.yml```, to deploy green version.
I wrote the outputs of my ```curl <service-ip>``` to the respective ```.txt``` files.
Unfortunately, I am unable to set CNAME, because I am using Kubernetes on docker desktop, as I was unable to setup a kubernetes cluster on my AWS account.
